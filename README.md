It will be better to first read the documentation of Pygame Module so as to get a better understanding about the code.
# How to Run In ur system
So, I used sublime text to code and got some png and jpeg images of things which i need for this game , also i used sounds in the game which if u want can edit
Keep the gallery folder and the python file in the same directory so as to get the program run smoothly.
Just Run the file named flappy.py in your IDE to get the demo of the game.
YOU can use your images and sounds if u want , just change the path name wherever necessary
